# Project1: Pours in the Outdoors
Have you ever been on a hike? No? Well you should try it out. As an experienced hiker I'd wager that once you're done with that hike you'll be pretty thirsty. And thirsty for something besides water, Gatorade and the taste of sunscreen. How's a beer sound? Our website lets you input a city and state showing the four closest hikes to the city center. Once you select the hike you'd like to go on, you'll then get four options for breweries and restaurants near said hike. And just because we like you, we'll even check the weather when you input the city of your choice. Not drinking a beer at the end of the hike is now a thing of the past. Make it an after every hike occurrence.

The API's we used:
https://developers.zomato.com/
https://openweathermap.org/api
https://www.hikingproject.com/data

The CSS framework we used:
BULMA

We went heavy on the vanilla JS over JQUERY.
